      " 💡Fallen high-voltage line...Did you know???🤔How to save yourself when a high-voltage line falls. You could be shocked when in the area of a downed hashtag#power line. The minimum safe distance from a fallen electrical wire is 35 feet, according to hashtag#energy hashtag#company. This is about the length of an average hashtag#school bus. Make sure you keep hashtag#children and hashtag#pets away from that wire, as well.Be aware that hashtag#electricity may pass through soil, water, metal or even people or animals up to 8-10 meters away from a fallen power line. Move away from the area.Do not drive across a downed power line. If a power line falls on your hashtag#car, stay inside and wait for hashtag#help.This is the radius of danger of a fallen power line and provides a tip to avoid instant electrocuting. hashtag#physics hashtag#electricalengineering hashtag#training hashtag#electricalengineer hashtag#electrical hashtag#engineering hashtag#science hashtag#students hashtag#scienceandtechnology hashtag#students hashtag#learning hashtag#technology hashtag#education\n",

      " ~2.4 years. 856 days of silence. I am happy to announce with my hashtag#linkedIn hashtag#connections that the paper titled \"QSKA: A Quantum Secured Privacy-Preserving Mutual Authentication Scheme for Energy Internet-Based Vehicle-to-Grid Communication\" with authors Kumar Prateek, Dr. Soumyadev Maity and Neetesh Saxena has been accepted as a regular paper in IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management (IEEE TNSM). ✨ ✨ ✨ Sleepless nights became my norm, doubt my constant companion. \"Is it worth it?\" echoed in my mind countless times. You sacrifice, you struggle, and the world moves on, oblivious to your efforts.In academia's glacial pace, unpublished work feels invisible, and apparently, patience stretches like a rubber band ready to snap.Amidst rigorous revisions, despair threatened to overtake me. But when I faltered, my co-authors Dr. Soumyadev Maity sir and Neetesh Saxena sir stood strong. With their unwavering support, we rejuvenated our revision submission, transforming despair into triumph!!!But today, upon receiving the acceptance mail, I feel a sense of relaxation. I want to express my sincere gratitude to Dr. Soumyadev Maity Sir and Neetesh Saxena Sir for being the pillars of support. Sir, I will be forever grateful to both of you for the consistent technical input and handholding throughout the process.I also want to show my sincere gratitude to all my hashtag#seniors, hashtag#phd_clis_seniors and hashtag#friends for sharing their insights, opinions, participating in fruitful discussions, deliberations and even helping me out professionally whenever the need arises.Note: The reviews we received were exceptionally technical, playing an important role in substantially improving the quality of our paper. We are grateful to all the hashtag#reviewers for their dedicated and selfless efforts to upgrade the scientific community. As a fellow reviewer for different venue, I empathize with the time constraints and challenges the reviewers face in the timely review submission. hashtag#PhDStruggle hashtag#AcademicPerseverance hashtag#NeverGiveUp hashtag#PerseveranceWins hashtag#Gratitude hashtag#IIITA hashtag#IEEE hashtag#TNSM hashtag#Transactions hashtag#Gratitude hashtag#Positivity\n",

      " 3 Mistakes That I Made and You Should Avoid if You’re Switching to a Product-based Company 💔 😔.Getting into a PBC is a dream of many working professionals and I had this dream too However, making mistakes along the way can cost you precious opportunities. 😓Here are three mistakes I made and why it's important to overcome them. 👇🏿❌ Mistake 1️⃣ : I underestimated the complexity of technical interviews at PBCs. In the beginning my preparation was focused more on theoretical knowledge rather than practical problem-solving. ❌ Mistake 2️⃣:I focused too heavily on DSA, neglecting the importance of system design. Coming from a service-based background, my experience with designing large-scale systems was limited, and I didn’t spend enough time on it. ❌ Mistake 3️⃣:I didn't properly familiarize myself with the specific tech stack and tools used by the PBC I was applying to. While I had strong software development skills, but I lacked experience with specific frameworks, cloud services, and CI/CD pipelines.✅Remember, learning from mistakes is crucial, and overcoming these challenges will bring you one step closer to your dream job at your dream company Now, If you’re someone who needs help in improving the areas mentioned above and want a structured curriculum & Guidance I would suggest checking Bosscoder Academy Check here: https://bit.ly/3ya6ztT They provide a well-structured program that can help you master DSA, System Design, and Full Stack Development along with personal mentorship and 24/7 doubt supporthashtag#collab hashtag#mistakes hashtag#careerswitch\n",
